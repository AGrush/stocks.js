`stocks.js` allows easy retrieval of stock data - without having to pay a single
dollar. The library uses [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) as its
data source. Next to regular time series data, there are a bunch of technical
indicators that can be tracked with this library.

> :bulb: This library is very new, so you might experience issues. If you do,
please report them at the [issues](https://github.com/wagenaartje/stocks.js/issues)
section. 

This is an example of regular stock time series retrieval
([click to run](https://jsfiddle.net/wagenaartje/2pph8rax/)):


```js
// Let's get the stock data of Tesla Inc. for the last 10 minutes
var result = await stocks.timeSeries({
  symbol: 'TSLA',
  interval: '1min',
  amount: 10
 });
```

And this is an example of how to retrieve a [technical indicator](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#technical-indicators)
([click to run](https://jsfiddle.net/wagenaartje/2pph8rax/1/)):

```js
// Let's get the directional movement index of Microsoft Corporation for the
// last 20 years, with 10 data points used to calculate every point
var result = await stocks.technicalIndicator({
  symbol: 'MSFT',
  interval: 'monthly',
  indicator: 'ADX',
  time_period: 10
});
```

## Getting started
The first step is downloading the `dist/stocks.js` file to your local machine.
Sadly, we don't host this file yet, but we will get to that soon. Link the file
in your `.html` file:

```html
<script src="stocks.js"></script>
```

You can also install stocks.js with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (latest
version required):

```cmd
npm install stocks.js --save
```

Now you have to request your *personal API Key* at Alpha Vantage. Claim your
API Key [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Now in another
`.js` file, write the following code:

```js
stocks.API_KEY = 'XXXX'; // replace XXXX with your API Key
```

Basically, you're good to go! You can use any of the functions without a hassle
now. View the *Usage* paragraph below to see how you can fetch data.


## Usage
The first function to discuss is the `stocks.timeSeries()` function. This
function allows you to retrieve data from now, up to 20 years to the past. The
basic usage is as follows:

```js
var result = await stocks.timeSeries(options);
```

where *options* is an object containing any of the following options:

* `REQ symbol`, the symbol of the stock you want to follow. An example of this
is 'TLSA'. There is no list of symbols, I have requested a list at Alpha
Vantage.
* `REQ interval`, the interval of the data points you want to retrieve. Choose
from any of the following intervals: '1min', '5min', '15min', '30min', '60min',
'daily', 'weekly' and 'monthly'. Any interval shorter than daily will only fetch
the data points of the current day.
* `amount`, the amount of data points to fetch. If not specified, will return
all possible data points up to a maximum twenty years ago.

So an example of options could be:

```js
var options = {
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  interval: 'weekly',
  amount: 52
};
```

The result of such a request is an array with `amount` elements, easy element is
an object that includes the following keys and corresponding values:

```js
close, high, low, open, volume, date
```

The second function offered in `stocks.js` is `stocks.technicalIndicator()`,
which allows you to fetch certain technical indicators regarding the stock. The
basic usage is as follows:

```js
var result = await stocks.timeSeries(options)
```

where *options* is an object containing any of the following options:

* `REQ symbol`, the symbol of the stock you want to follow. An example of this
is 'TLSA'. There is no list of symbols, I have requested a list at Alpha
Vantage.
* `REQ indicator`, the indicator of which you want to fetch data. Currently,
only a handful of indicators are supported. Way more will follow soon. Supported
indicators: [ADX](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#adx),
[ADXR](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#adxr),
[BOP](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#bop),
[CCI](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#cci),
[AROON](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#aroon),
[AROONOSC](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#aroonosc),
[MFI](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#mfi),
[DX](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#dx),
[MINUS_DI](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#minusdi),
[PLUS_DI](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#plusdi),
[PLUS_DM](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#plusdm),
[MIDPRICE](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#midprice),
[TRANGE](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#trange),
[ATR](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#atr),
[NATR](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#natr),
[AD](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#ad) and
[OBV](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#obv)
* `REQ interval`, the interval of the data points you want to retrieve. Choose
from any of the following intervals: '1min', '5min', '15min', '30min', '60min',
'daily', 'weekly' and 'monthly'. Any interval shorter than daily will only fetch
the data points of the current day.
* `REQ time_period`, the time period to calculate certain indicators from. For
example, if set to 10, the indicator value will be calculated using 10 data
points. Does not affect all indicators.
* `amount`, the amount of data points to fetch. If not specified, will return
all possible data points up to a maximum twenty years ago.

```js
var options = {
  symbol: 'NOK',
  interval: '60min',
  amount: 24,
  time_period: 3,
  indicator: 'ADX'
};
```

The result of such a request is an array with `amount` elements, easy element is
an object that includes the following keys and corresponding values:

```js
(indicator name), date
```

## Further notices
All the data comes from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/), although
they exist for some time now, it is quite unclear what their business model is.
They also don't provide a lot of information on their sources and why an API
Key is needed. So please note the risk that from one day to the other their
service might stop.
